Description: graphical application for managing Xfce settings
 xfce4-settings is the Xfce settings manager front-end. It comes
 with several different components for configuring application-independent
 settings inside xfconf.
 It contains multiple tools:
  - xfce4-settings-manager (which replaces the old mcs settings manager),
    which executes the various (provided) settings dialogs
  - xfce4-settings-editor, a tool for editing ALL settings within xfconf, the
    graphical counterpart of xfconf-query.
  - xfsettingsd, a daemon for exporting XSettings to applications, and
    providing special features like keyboard shortcuts, AccessX notification
    and update of keyboard and mouse-pointer data.
